Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance in testline quizzes and predicts their NEET rank based on past quiz results and previous NEET exam scores. It extracts insights on topic strengths, weak areas, and performance trends.

Key Features
Fetch & Process Data from API endpoints.
Analyze Performance across topics & difficulty levels.
Generate Insights on weak areas & improvements.
Predict NEET Rank using a Machine Learning model.

Approach Description
Step 1: Data Fetching & Preprocessing
Fetch current quiz data and historical quiz data using requests.
Clean & structure data using Pandas.
Step 2: Performance Analysis
Compute accuracy by topic & difficulty.
Identify weak topics and improvement trends.
Generate visual insights using Matplotlib/Seaborn.
Step 3: Rank Prediction Model
Train a Random Forest/XGBoost model on past NEET data.
Use quiz scores, topic accuracy, and trends as features.
Predict expected NEET rank.
Step 4: Output & Reporting
Display rank predictions & improvement suggestions.
Optionally, deploy as a Flask/FastAPI web service.
